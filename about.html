      <h2>Origins & Founders</h2>
      <p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, but 
        Miyazaki and Takahata have a relationship that far predates this. Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki met in the 1960s 
        when working for the Japanese animation studio Tôei Dôga. 
        
      <p>The two men worked together for more than a decade notably on the animation Heidi. But it wasn't until the early 
        1980s, when the growth of animation on television threatened the quality of productions, that these two enthusiasts 
        decided to join forces to offer the public a quality animated feature film that would not overlook either the narration 
        or the direction. </p>

      <p>In 1985, a first collaboration ensues, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, the animated adaptation 
        of the manga published by Miyazaki in the magazine Animage. On the strength of this first success, and convinced 
        that there is a place for quality animated feature films on the Japanese market, they set up a small production 
        studio in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the help of the Tokuma Shoten publishing company.Toshio Suzuki was part of the 
        production team on Nausicaä. Buoyed by the film’s performance, Miyazaki and Suzuki decided to set up their own studio 
        and invited Takahata to join them. Tokuma-Shoten, the Tokyo-based publishing company, provided the necessary funding 
        to found Studio Ghibli, and so a journey was started that would result in 21 feature films and a reputation as one of 
        the world’s best animation studios. </p>

      <h2>Awards</h2>
      <p>One of Japan’s most distinctive filmmakers, Hayao Miyazaki has earned acclaim and recognition for his anime features 
        since his debut in 1979 with The Castle of Cagliostro.  In 1985 he co-founded Studio Ghibli, which has since become a 
        major name in the worlds of animation and international filmmaking. His subsequent films included Nausicaä of the Valley 
        of the Wind (1984), Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Princess Mononoke (1997), Howl’s Moving Castle 
        (2004), Ponyo (2008) and The Wind Rises (2013). His 2001 feature, Spirited Away, won an Academy Award for Animated 
        Feature. In 2014, he was chosen to receive an Honorary Award at the Academy’s Governors Awards.</p>
      
      <p> One ofStudio Ghibli's most successful film is Spirited Away. At the 75th Academy Awards, Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away won 
        best animated feature in the second year of the category’s existence — and, to this day, it is the only hand-drawn 
        feature (mostly; computers were used sparingly) to win the honor.Made on a budget of $19 million ($30 million in 2021) 
        — 10 percent of which was covered by Disney, which handled U.S. distribution and English dubbing — Spirited Away brought 
        in $275 million worldwide ($430 million today), overtaking Titanic to become Japan’s highest-grossing film for 19 years. 
        With subsequent rereleases, the coming-of-age fantasy took in an additional $85 million at the box office. </p>

      <div class="outline">
      <h2>Going International</h2>
      <p>Outside Asia (including Japan) and North America since 2003, Wild Bunch has held international sales rights to Ghibli's 
        film library and serves as a distributor itself in France and Belgium along with home media rights released under the 
        Wild Side Vidéo label (distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment France).The company also sells distribution 
        rights to separate distributors across the world, including StudioCanal UK/Elysian Film Group (United Kingdom and 
        Ireland), Universum Film (Germany), Lucky Red (Italy), Vértigo Films (Spain) and Madman Entertainment (Australia 
        and New Zealand). 
        
      <p>Notably, The Secret World of Arrietty received a second dub exclusive to the United Kingdom, produced 
        by StudioCanal, likely due to the film's origins being from Mary Norton's British novel The Borrowers. Disney formerly 
        held the international sales rights as well until Wild Bunch's purchase in 2003. Eight were present during the meeting, 
        with the Disney side being Buena Vista president Michael O. Johnson, chief of staff Greg Probert, senior corporate 
        lawyer Brett Chapman, and Koji Hoshino, the head of Disney of Japan, while on the Tokuma there was its chairman 
        Yasuyoshi Tokuma, Toshio Suzuki, a liaison who worked at Tokuma International named Steve Alpert. The contract had 
        gone through many challenges over the course of two years, often due to turnover of staff and disputes such as Disney 
        demanding they hold the rights to Ghibli films for ten instead of five years. Some Disney executives even scoffed at 
        having to deal with what they saw was a "small time publisher" like Tokuma Shoten.</p>
        
      <p>Disney kept the French distribution rights to Ghibli's library until September 2020, when it had expired and 
        transitioned off to Wild Bunch. Since 2021, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment serves as the home media distributor of 
        Studio Ghibli's catalog via its distribution deal with Wild Bunch through the Wild Side Vidéo label.</p>
